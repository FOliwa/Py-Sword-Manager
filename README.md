# ‚öîÔ∏èüêç PySwordManager - A simple password manager in Python.

It's a practical project that involves both Python programming and basic cybersecurity practices like secure storage and encryption.

Here's a high-level overview and goals of the project:

- Create a Python program that allows users to store and manage their passwords securely.
- Implement features to add, retrieve, update, and delete passwords for different accounts.
- Use encryption techniques like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to securely store passwords.
- Utilize hashing functions like SHA-256 to securely handle master passwords.
- Prompt users to enter a master password to access the password manager.
- Ensure the master password is not stored in plaintext but is securely hashed and compared.
